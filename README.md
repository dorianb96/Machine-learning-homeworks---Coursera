# Machine Learning course from Andrew Ng,Stanford
Homeworks from popular machine learning course done in Python
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning


All homeworks for this course are originally made for/in matlab,
but I wanted a challenge of setting up the whole project infrastructure and learning useful python libraries such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib...

The first 2 notebooks are not ideal python code and should be rewritten, 
but latter notebooks are quite good and you can see in the notebook format the results are same as Andrew Ng's.
