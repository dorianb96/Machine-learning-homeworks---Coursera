# Machine Learning course from Andrew Ng,Stanford

These are homework exercises for one of the most famous Massive Open Online courses - https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning  

All homeworks for this course were originally made for matlab. Because they were automatically graded they were very structured and not as challenging. 

But to challenge myself I decided to do the homeworks in Python which meant a lot more infrastructure work. 
But it also allowed me to learn interesting tools such as scipy, numpy, matplotlib...


The first 2 notebooks have subpar python code quality and should be rewritten, 
but latter notebooks have a higher standard.  

You can see in the notebook output cells that the results are same as Andrew Ng's.
